            The packet begins with a header byte, which has header protection
            applied.  Header protection is used to hide packet numbers and other
            information from outside observers.
            <br><br>
            Header protection is applied by encrypting a sample of each packet's
            payload with the "header protection key", then XOR'ing certain bits
            and bytes in each packet with the resulting data. For "long" format
            packets such as this one, the protected sections are the lower 4 bits
            of this byte, and the bytes of the Packet Number (seen later).
            <br><br>
            An example of how to compute header protection:
            <codesample>
<pre><code>### "client header protection key" from calc step above
$ key=6df4e9d737cdf714711d7c617ee82981
### sample is taken from 16 bytes of payload starting
### 4 bytes past the first byte of the packet number
$ sample=ed78716be9711ba498b7ed868443bb2e
$ echo $sample | xxd -r -p | openssl aes-128-ecb -K $key | head -c 5 | xxd -p

ed9895bb15

### first byte of result is xor'd into lower 4 bits of this byte,
### remaining bytes are xor'd one-for-one into the bytes of
### the packet number (which in this packet is only one byte)
</code></pre>
            </codesample>
            The bits in the unprotected byte 0xC0 have the following meaning:
            <table class="bits">

            The first byte starts with the two bits "0 1" (0x4), which

            This byte has header protection applied, see Packet Header Byte for

            This byte has the unprotected value of 0x00, indicating it is packet

            This data is also potentially truncated. The
            sending endpoint calculates the spread between
            the highest packet number sent and the lowest
            unacknowledged packet number, doubles that
            spread for safety, rounds up, then figures the
            number of bytes it can remove from the high
            bits of the packet number to unambiguously
            represent a number between those two ends. The
            encoded packet number is then truncated to that
            number of bytes, and the receiving endpoint
            fills in the full number based on the packet
            numbers it has most recently seen. Because our
            example conversation sends so few packets (fewer
            than 64), this truncation won't occur in this
            document.  See <a

            Padding this packet to a size of 1200 bytes serves two purposes:
            <ul>

            <li><b>Path MTU validation</b> - Any IPv4 host or
            router is allowed to drop packets
            that exceed their MTU limit, to a minimum of
            576 bytes. The vast majority of the internet
            has a much higher MTU (typically 1500 bytes). A higher
            packet size will increase throughput and
            performance. Given these realities QUIC chooses
            a minimum size constraint of 1200 bytes, which
            should traverse the vast majority of real
            networks (including tunneled networks)
            without being dropped for size.
            <br>
            To prevent a scenario where a connection is established
            successfully with smaller packets but then starts timing out
            once larger packets are sent, the initial packets are
            padded to a length of 1200 bytes to prove that the
            end-to-end path will allow packets of that size.

            <li><b>Amplification Attack Mitigation</b> - There is a class
            of network attack in which an attacker
            can send a small amount of traffic to an innocent third party
            which replies with a much larger amount of traffic directed
            at the target. In the case of QUIC this could be done with
            IP address spoofing, and would cause QUIC servers to reply
            to small Initial datagrams with much larger Handshake responses.
            <br>
            To help mitigate this, QUIC servers are forbidden from replying to a
            client with more than 3 times the traffic that was sent to it,
            until the server has received some proof from the client that
            it's at the given address (such as round-trip data originally from the server).
            Adding padding to this Initial datagram gives the server a "byte budget"
            to perform handshake responses without exceeding this 3x limit.
